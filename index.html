            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <p>We are students of BML Munjal University, participated in <span>Hackhound - 2K23</span> organized by
                <span>Major League Hacking</span>, which was conducted between 4-5 March 2023. The event was held at
                <span>SRM Insitute of Science and Technology, Modinagar, Ghaziabad.</span><br><br>
                Our team<span>(Angry Nerds)</span> consisted of 4 team Members - <span>Dharmanshu Singh, Ayush Kumar,
                    Sankalp Mane, Daksh Goel.</span><br><br>

                <span>Problem Statement :</span><br>
                Many gamers struggle with improving their aim and accuracy in shooter games, resulting in frustration
                and poor performance. An aim trainer is needed to provide an efficient and effective way for gamers to
                practice their aim, improve their reaction time, and enhance their overall gameplay experience. The aim
                trainer should offer a variety of customizable exercises and challenges, as well as feedback and
                progress tracking to help gamers identify areas for improvement and monitor their progress over
                time.<br><br>

                <span>Challenges we ran into :</span><br>
                Since we were working on Unity for the first time, we really struggled a lot to model the fully
                functional FPS aim trainer game and at last, it didn't work so <span>we developed a 2D-Aim Trainer game
                    in Javascript</span>. Besides these, since most of our time was consumed in learning Unity, we
                couldn't add much functionality in the back-end.
